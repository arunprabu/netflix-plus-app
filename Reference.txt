React 
========
Creating React App 
  npx create-react-app my-app

Components 
============
  1. Functional Components (To learn)
      1.1 Functional component with Named Function [DONE]
      1.2 Functional component with Anonymous Function [DONE]
      1.3 Functional component with Arrow Function [DONE] [RECOMMENDED]

      * are coded with functions 
      * were called as stateless components / dumb components (before react v 16.8)
      * react introduced hooks in react v16.8. that offered support to keep state in functional components 
      * can connect to rest api using react hook 


  2. Class Components (NOT RECOMMENDED)
      * coded with class 
      * were called as stateful components / smart components / containers 
      * connecting to rest api was possible with life cycle hook methods 
    


JSX & its Limitations 
==============
  * will look like HTML --but not 
  * all tags must be closed -- either self-close or separately close 
  * class attribute should become className 
  * style attribute should accept styles as object 



Project Structure if you are doing unit testing inside src and individual components
============
  src/
    components/
      Header/
        Header.js
        Header.css
        Header.test.js 
      Footer/
      MenuList/
    pages/  
      HomePage/
        LatestVideo/
    

Project Structure if you are doing unit testing inside src within __tests__ folder
============
  src/
    components/
      Header.js 
      Footer.js 
      MenuList.js 
    pages/
      HomePage/
        HomePage.js 
        LatestVideo.js
        TrendingVideos.js 
        TrendingVideo.js 
      AboutPage/
        AboutPage.js

===========
Naming conventions & Casing Types
----
  Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * Recommended for React Components and the folder of the components
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html elements 
        * if your architect approves, you can have css classes in this convention

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names, assets in front end projects  
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect accepts

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case 
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;


Data Binding 
---
  * keeping the data in variables in component and displaying it in comp's jsx 

Cross Component Communication 
----
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication [DONE]
      using props 
      
  2. Child to Parent Component Communication [TODO] [DONE]
      using props and passing event handler to the child comp and executing 

  3. Any to Any Component Communication
      3.1 using Context API
      3.2 using redux framework (third party tool)



React Hooks 
------------
  * introduced in 2019, in react v16.8.
  * help functional components have state data, and connect to back end using hooks 
  
  Rules of Hooks
  ----------
    Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

    1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
    2. Only call Hooks from React function components. 
        Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 
        (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks â€” your own custom Hooks. We'll learn about them later.)

    useState() 
    useEffect() 
    useRef()
    useReducer()
    useContext() 
    useId()
    useMemo(), 
    useCallback()

  Custom Hooks


Styling in React 
----
  1. Global styles [DONE]
  2. Component Specific Styles using css modules [DONE]
  3. Internal Styles [DONE]
  4. Inline Styles [DONE]
  5. Learn about styled-components [TODO]

==================
Routing in React JS 
---------

SPA (Single Page Apps)
----------------------
  7 Characteristics
  ==================
    1. Pages should not reload / refresh [DONE]
    2. URL should change [DONE]
    3. History should be maintained w/o page refresh [DONE]
    4. Header and footer should not be loaded again and again [DONE]
    5. The section in b/w header and footer should show contextual updates [DONE]
    6. Active menu should be set [TODO]
    7. Page Title should also be changed [TODO]

Let's Intergrate react-router-dom to make our app as SPA 
================
  Step 0. npm i react-router-dom 
  Step 1. Identify the Menus and the URLs 
          Home          - localhost:3000/
          About Us      - localhost:3000/about-us 
          Contact Us    - localhost:3000/contact-us 

          Let's update the URLs properly in MenuList comp 
 
  Step 2: Let's create AboutUsPage, ContactUsPage components 

  Step 3: Let's config the routes in App component. have the entire app, under
          the control of BrowserRouter of react-router-dom. 
          Then, have the routing config.

  Step 4: Check the App. URL will change. 
          Section in between header and footer will get updated. 

          Pages are still getting refreshed. Let's fix. 
          replace <a href with <Link    in MenuList comp  
  
          It's over! Now we have SPA.
