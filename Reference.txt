===========
Naming conventions & Casing Types
----
  Casing Types 
  --------
    1. PascalCase 
        * Recommended for Object Oriented Program's classes 
        * Recommended for React Components and the folder of the components
        * also Recommended for Interface in Java & TypeScript 

        examples 
        ---
          class CarDetails {

          }

          interface Employee {

          }

    2. camelCase 
        * Recommended for variables, const, functions, methods in JS & TS 
        * Recommended for id's of html elements 

        examples 
        -----
          var myCar = 'BMW';

          function getCarInfo() {
            //....
          }
    
    3. kebab-case
        * Recommended for URLs 
        * Recommended for file names, folder names, assets in front end projects  
        * Recommended for css classes 
        * okay for id's of html elements if your architect accepts

        examples 
        -----
          btn-primary
          slideshow-container 
          youtube-logo.png 

    4. snake_case 
        * never ever use this. 
        * okay for const in JS & TS if architect accepts

        examples
        ---
          const MAX_STUDENTS_PER_CLASS = 30;
